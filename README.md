# Advent of Code 2016

### My solutions in C++

The purpose of this repository is to share solutions to 
aforementioned problems with my friend, or any other curious 
individual that stumbles upon this repo.

The main goal of all solutions shall not be execution speed (although
solutions should still be running at reasonable speed), but
readability and cleanliness of all code written.

With that being said, due to coding still only being a hobby of mine,
it is possible that the solutions to complex problems will be short
of proper form, because of my lack of understanding of complex
problem solving.
